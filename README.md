## üéß First-Time Use: Spotify Login

The first time you use `chorear`, it will open your browser to authenticate with Spotify. This creates a token locally at `~/.cache-zotify` so you won‚Äôt have to log in again.

If you prefer to use your own Spotify Developer credentials, you can set these environment variables in your shell config:

```bash
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI='http://localhost:8888/callback'
```
